üïµÔ∏è About me
===
Hi, I‚Äôm Waldemar. I will be delighted if you care to reach me! 

I‚Äôm always seeking new ways to expand my knowledge. In [Allegro.pl] ‚Äî [the most popular shopping platform in Poland](https://about.allegro.eu/who-we-are/at-a-glance)
‚Äî I‚Äôve managed to advance from a junior software engineer to a team leader in just 3 years. 
My job involves managing projects & people, but I‚Äôm pleased to tell you that I still code. Right now, I dive into how to be a good manager and make better software simultaneously.

I have a strong technical experience that I‚Äôve gained through the years. I use it to recruit new software engineers to Allegro.pl. 
Of course, I practice my knowledge through building applications in the microservice architecture. 
In my team we use [Kotlin coroutines], [Apache Kafka] & the [service mesh] to be more resilient and in alignment with the [reactive manifesto].

I love to share my know-how with the community. Together with [Karol Teske] ‚Äî the host of [Allegro Tech Live] ‚Äî and [Adam Dudczak] ‚Äî the facilitator of [GeeCon conference] ‚Äî we organize [Jugademy] meetings. 
It‚Äôs a series of presentations created by experienced software engineers for IT newcomers. I make [posts] of things that I find useful and worth spreading. I am active at [LinkedIn] & [Twitter].
